This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is built on top of Node 12. For optimal performance, I suggest to use Node 12 while running this locally.

# Frameworks and Libraries used:

1. react v16
2. node-sass for scss
3. jest for unit testing
4. typescript v3

# User Stories

1. Provide an easy way so that users can contact a Team member. A user should be able to navigate the interface via keyboard. The app will be responsive and render well on modern desktop browsers as well as mobile devices.
2. Build without using any css framework.
